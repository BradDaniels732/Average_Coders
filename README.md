# Economic Data Analysis

Our first group project designed to highlight use/knowledge of Python, Pandas, loading data from CSV and APIs, creating visualizations in  MatplotLib.

As one of our group members works in the oil field services industry, we took a look at economic data that could explain changes in employment and wages in the oil field.

We used data from the Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistic, and the US Energy Information Administration

We found that changes in the overall employment level in the US preceeded changes in average hourly earnings, though the leadtime varied greatly, making precise estimates of changes in average hourly earnings difficult. Changes in long-term interest rates seemed to be more coincident with changes in hourly earnings.
