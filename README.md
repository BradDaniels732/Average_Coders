# Average_Coders
The Average Coders Project

Our first group project designed to highlight use/knowledge of Python, Pandas, loading data from CSV and APIs, creating visualizations in  MatplotLib.

As one of our group members works in the oil field services industry, we took a look at economic data that could explain changes in employment and wages in the oil field.
